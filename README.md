# L5R-Tools

This is a very small (two!) set of tools for a GM of the Legend of the 5 Rings system. It has two functionalities at the moment.
# L5R Dragruler.
This tool is a conversion of the Foundry VTT Drag Ruler module for Legend of the 5 Rings. This shows what range band you are currently moving to from your current start point. The grids are also color-coded. 

This works for gridless and hexagonal maps as well. I hope to eventually implement terrain types, "Difficult squares" and diagonal movement. 

# L5R Opportunity Tracker
This tool determines the number of opportunities taken after rolling and accepting your results. It then outputs available opportunities based on ring, skillgroup and so on.

Very grateful to ManuelVo ( https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler ) and wrycu ( https://github.com/wrycu/StarWarsFFG-Enhancements/tree/main/scripts ) for inspiration.
